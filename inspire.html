        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>
            A hero is someone who inspires and uplifts others through their actions, making a positive impact on the world around them. They stand out not just for their courage or accomplishments, but for their kindness, integrity, and the ability to bring out the best in others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Joe Gatto is my hero because of his infectious humor, authenticity, and ability to spread joy through his work on <em>Impractical Jokers</em>. His commitment to making people laugh, his kindness, and his openness about his personal life inspire me. Despite his fame, he stays down-to-earth, and his dedication to family, animals, and positivity makes him a true role model in my life.
